To easily see how the goal attempts change throughout a match, the goal attempts of an entire season has been aggregated and then
split into intervals such that it is possible to see the distance from the goal a goal attempt is made during the first 10 minutes, the next
10 minutes and so on. This information has been visualized using a box plot. As it is described in the theory section, a box plot quickly
allows a user to see different things about a data set, and therefore functions as a quick way to propose hypotheses about the data.
