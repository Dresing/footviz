\section{Process Evaluation}
At our first meeting in the group we made the group contract. We discussed how we would like distribute our work and what we should do to cooperate in the most successful way. Early in our process we also met with the company Prozone, which is the company providing us our data. Here we got information about their data, current tools, and what they could offer us. It seemed very promising but unfortunately the process of getting the data was a long one. It took around a month to get access to the API, which of course made our work a bit harder, because we did not know exactly what data we could get access to. We got some data from the beginning but this was very limited. Because of that most of our visualisations are based on this test data, and scaled when we finally got access to more.

Because of the lack in data, we had focus on the theory the first weeks. We explored the the theoretical materials by our own, and later on discussed them in the group. This has generally been the process of our work. Also when getting access to the API we could start to share knowledge about the data we could get. We have programmed our visualisations individually and helped each other with the understand the programming languages. If one had problems we tried together to solve these. During the design process we also gave each other feedback on our specific visualisations. 

At the midway seminar we had some ideas about what we would like to visualise, and had some base visualisations to show. 

Feedback on midway seminar.

Generally the group have met a couple of times a week, to discuss progress and theory. We evaluate how long we have come, and what the next step is. We met once a week with our supervisor to get feedback on our work. The group meeting have typically been placed before and after each meeting with our supervisor, to respectively discus what our agenda to the meet should be, and what we should do next based on the feedback from our supervisor.

We have had no major conflicts, only small disagreements with our supervisor about what we thought the project should be about, and which topics we should include.

We had given a time line over the project. We have had big problems following this, because of the late data arrival. A lot of time has also been wasted on email correspondence with Prozone concerning the data. This also means that the process has been somewhat even more compressed and pushed to the end.
