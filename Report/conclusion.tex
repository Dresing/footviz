Some of the patterns which were found, seemed to indicate a tendencies for bottom-tier team's to generally speaking shoot more, especially from outside of the box. Whilst looking at how a team's play-style changed throughout a match, we found a relatively clear indication that teams tend to shoot more frequently as the game progresses. The root of cause was not clear but one could suggest that either teams become more desperate as the game progresses, or maybe the defense line cuts a bit more slack later into the game and make more pressure based errors. It also seemed like teams were at higher risk of making unsuccessful passes at the beginning of each half, indicating that some factors must apply that causes players to perform slightly worse, which may be attributed to factors such as pressure or uncertainty of the opponent. Though these conclusions were supported by a substantial amount of quantitative records, some other tendencies were also found which were slightly less supported. The top-tier teams seemed to change their play-style in matches against bottom-tier teams but it depended heavily on what the outcome was. Especially factors such as failed passes seemed to truly change depending on whom the opponent was, as it would often be higher if the opponent was worse on paper, in respect to playing against an on paper even opponent. Another tendency which was found, was that a losing team may start playing more towards the middle of the field when being behind, as opposed to being ahead in the match. Although this theory is very poorly supported, it may very well lay grounds for a new hypothesis which is yet to be proven.
